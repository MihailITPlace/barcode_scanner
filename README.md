# barcode scanner kotlin

Linux Kotlin code example to read from a USB barcode scanner directly.

The example uses the library usb4java.

[This project](https://github.com/vpatron/barcode_scanner_python) was taken as a basis. (Give the guy a star!)

The code is run from **sudo**. Or you can set up rules for accessing devices.
To do this, read the instructions from the [original repository](https://github.com/vpatron/barcode_scanner_python).
